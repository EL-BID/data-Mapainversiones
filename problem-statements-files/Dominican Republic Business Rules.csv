No, Bussines Rules, Description detail
1, There must be a unique identifier per project (Project_Id), The projects in the investment map system must be unique. If they do not exist, one must be generated that can be established as a unique key for the projects and be numerical to facilitate queries.
2, There must be a single code to identify the project in the public investment system (cod_snip), Projects in investment systems must have a unique identification code that can be understood by officials and/or citizens to monitor the project from the search engine.
3, Projects must have an associated sector or function, Projects on the investment map must have an associated sector for which filters or profiles associated with sectors can be created.
4, Projects must have an associated executing entity and/or person responsible for the project., The projects in the investment map must be associated with executing entities and/or those responsible for the project in the Dominican Republic. The executing entities and those responsible for the project are the same.
5, Projects must contain a funding source and associated funding body., The projects in the investment map must have financing sources and it is important to know the financing organizations, this to determine where the resources come from and what the flow of these is like.
6, Projects must contain an adequate description of the same, with characters and words that contextualize the general characteristic of the project a little., Projects on the investment map must have an adequate description, since this will allow citizens to be explained what the project is about within the project profiles and must have coherent words.
7, Projects must have a start date (start year) and end date (end year), The projects on the investment map are filtered by year ranges, for citizens it is important to generate filters within the map with this characteristic that allows knowing the horizon of the project and its duration.
8, Projects must have the approved and/or current amount (cost) associated with the project. For the Dominican case it is the total_cost., For citizens, it is important to know the cost associated with the project; each government defines which variable best identifies this value.
9, Projects must have states and/or stages that clearly identify the status of the project. In the case of Dominican Republic, the possible current states are (Under reassessment or Approved, completed, in execution, paralyzed)., Citizens seek to know the statuses and/or stages of the projects in order to monitor them.
10, The projects must have a physical progress programmed in the schedule for each of the states., When the projects are configured, the components and physical goals defined must be configured or have in the schedule, in order to be able to track them. In Investment Map the aim is for citizens to be able to monitor how projects are progressing at a physical level.
11, Projects must have a physical progress executed when their status is executed and/or completed., As the projects are executed, there must be physical progress and you must know how much of the project has been accomplished, if it has met the established goals.
12, Projects must have a defined goal different from 0 in the different states, When setting project component goals for physical progress, these goals should be different from 0 in different states.
13, Projects must have an executed goal different from 0 when they are in executed state, It is expected that if a project is in execution status, it has clear defined goals and they are different from 0.
14, The projects in Dominican are grouped into two phases (pre-investment and investment), the projects must have a defined phase for the different states., It is expected that if a project is in execution status, it has clear defined goals and they are different from 1.
15, Projects must have a budget independent of the state in which they are located, When a project is defined it must have a budget assigned.
16, Projects must have a scheduled budget greater than 0, It is expected that when the project is defined the programmed budget will be greater than 0. The programmed budget is the one defined when a project is being conceived.
17, Projects must have an approved budget greater than 0 in their different states, It is expected that when the project is defined the approved budget will be greater than 0. The approved budget is the one that has been approved once the project has viability.
18, Projects must have at least one location assigned, MapaInversiones requires location information to be able to filter the projects on the map. A project can have one or more locations, taking into account that there are projects of national scope. In Dominican Republic, locations are defined as Provinces and Municipalities.
19, Projects must have associated components at the level of physical schedule, physical and financial execution (budgetary)., There must be coherence within the information if there are components at the physical execution level, it must exist in the programming (schedule) and at the financial (budget) level, to have coherence and be able to carry out traceability and monitoring of the different components.
20, Within the investment budget lines there must be investment projects associated through the SNIP code, When the budget is made and budget lines are defined, it is defined which projects it is associated with through the SNIP code.
21, In the snip project bank we find projects that are not in the budget for a specific period (year), Given that there is budget information from the SNIP of investment projects that is in the bank and there is also information from the Treasury budget, the information should be consistent. If there is information about a project in the SNIP project bank, it should also be in the treasury budget information and vice versa.
22, The current budget in the project bank for a given period should coincide with the current treasury budget (budget lines) in a given period., The budget information from the project bank must be consistent with the treasury budget information in a specific period and/or times.
23, How many treasury budget lines (snips) have associated contractual processes and in what states these processes are located?, The budget and more specifically the investment projects after a time must make contracts in most cases and for this they must have associated contractual processes, this can help determine the results of the project and in turn determine if there may be delays in execution. of the projects and the budget given the times that the contracting processes may take. Here we seek to first review from the budget linkage how this association is.
24, How many investment projects have associated contractual processes, project status vs contractual process status?, To achieve complete traceability we seek to review everything from the budget to the investment projects and their association with the contracts to generally know; How many projects do not have associated processes and what is the status of the project vs. the status of the contractual process. These statuses can help us generate alerts that indicate when a project is in execution status, has an assigned budget, but does not have a contractual process and/or this contractual process is in a canceled status.
25, How many treasury budget lines (snips) have contracts associated with them and in what states are the contracts (were they signed, paid, demanded, cancelled)?, When a contractual process is generated, money is somehow being separated from the budget to cover the value of the process, this is known in Dominican as preventive and once the contract is made, that money is committed, that is, there is already an obligation as such to the making payment within the defined times. It is important to know the status of these contracts to be able to establish and define possible budget gaps and/or to be able to predict when money is required to be available for these payments.
26, How many investment projects have associated contracts, project status vs contract status?, Complete traceability will seek to know how far the projects are progressing and having contracts signed and in execution can be a good sign of progress, just as having contracts canceled, sued and/or not having contracts can pose problems in the execution of the projects.
