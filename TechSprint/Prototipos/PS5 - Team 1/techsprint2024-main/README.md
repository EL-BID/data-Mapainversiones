## OCDS AI Validator Demo

Under `ai_validator` we included a demo that assess the quality of OCDS records using NLP with VertexAI. Using specific system instructions and prompts we can obtain a `json` file with information about the quality of the data (e.g. if the tender description is relevant given the description of the tender items).

## Case Study: Dominic Republic

Under `case_study_dominican_republic` we provide a mapping into OCDS using the data from the Dominican Republic given in this TechSprint. The purpose of this is to illustrate the way data can be mapped to OCDS. As a more complex example, we are also giving an OCDS dataset of Compranet (https://upcp-compranet.hacienda.gob.mx/), which can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DBLK3625lBOViadeUAhM5sQoENnjVm6L/view?usp=sharing.
