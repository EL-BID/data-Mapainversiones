# **Trust in Public Procurement**

## **Overview**
This prototype is designed to analyze current contracts within government entities, specifically focusing on the Dominican Republic. By digitizing documents from pre-contractual stages, we create a catalog of prices and detailed descriptions of goods and services for emergency procurement. The primary goal is to assist public officials by providing a visualization tool that highlights potential inconsistencies in current and future contracts. This facilitates access to physical information and lays the foundation for querying data related to these types of contracts. Consequently, this enables the necessary historical price validations, helping to identify and prevent overbilling, which could undermine trust in the administration and potentially signal corruption.

## **Project Structure**
### 1. Data Pipeline
This folder contains all the scripts and configurations required for the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes. The data pipeline is responsible for ingesting and processing the data from various sources, preparing it for analysis and visualization.

### 2. PowerBI
This folder includes the PowerBI dashboards and reports. These visualizations are designed to help public officials easily identify inconsistencies in contracts and analyze the detailed catalog of goods and services.

### 3. Technical Documentation
All the technical details related to the project's architecture, data processing methodologies, and other relevant documentation can be found in this folder. This section provides the necessary information for understanding the system's implementation and potential future enhancements.
